> There have been several reports of apps randomly quitting while backgrounded. In most cases, this is not due to a bug in Backgrounder, but to a lack of memory resources.
>
> The iPhone OS is designed so that when resources become low, a notification is sent to inactive apps asking them to either free-up memory or to quit.
>
> The best practice is to not run too many (memory-intensive) apps at one time.
