> # Backgrounding Method
> ## (Default: Backgrounder)
> - - -
> This option determines whether or not an app is allowed to background, as well as how it should background.
>
> This is especially useful when Backgrounder is used with a task switcher such as Kirikae or ProSwitcher.
>
> * **Off**  
>     The app will quit when minimized.
> 
>     Apps with built-in backgrounding, such as Phone, Mail, Safari and iPod, will be forcibly terminated.
> 
> * **Native**  
>     The app will be backgrounded using the app's built-in backgrounding method, if available.
> 
>     Certain Apple apps, such as Phone, Mail, iPod and Safari, as well as some 3rd-party jailbreak apps, such as MobileTerminal, include support for backgrounding. For such apps, it is recommended to use this "Native" method instead of the "Backgrounder" method, as the native method normally requires less resources.
>
>     Note that for apps that do not include this built-in support, this method is the same as the "Off" method.
> 
>     Also note that selecting this method will also enable the "Enable at Launch" and "Stay Enabled" options. This is done so that, by default, the app will behave the same as it would if Backgrounder were not installed.
>
> * **Backgrounder**  
>     The app will continue to run as if it were still in the foreground.
> 
>     Note that the app does not know that it is in the background, and so it cannot release unneeded resources. This can be quite expensive both CPU and memory-wise.
>
>     This method is not recommended for apps that have built-in backgrounding support, such as Phone, Mail, iPod and Safari.
