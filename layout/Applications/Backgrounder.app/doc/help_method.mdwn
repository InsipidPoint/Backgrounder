>     Certain built-in applications, such as Phone, Mail, iPod and Safari, as well as some 3rd-party jailbreak applications, such as MobileTerminal, include support for backgrounding. When backgrounding such applications, it is recommended to use this native support (via the "Native" method) instead of the "Backgrounder" method, as the native method normally requires less resources. Note that applications that do not include this built-in support will behave the same as with the "Off" method.
