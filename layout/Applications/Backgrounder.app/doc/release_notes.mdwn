> # Version svn.r521
> - - -
> * NEW: On iOS 4.x, the "Native" method will now enable fast-app switching even for apps that have not yet been updated for iOS 4.x.
>    - This also works with the "Backgrounder" method when "Fall Back to Native" is ON.
>    - Currently this is disabled for non-App Store apps.
>    - Some developers purposely disable fast-app switching (by setting UIApplicationExitsOnSuspend flag in Info.plist); Backgrounder respects this setting.
>    - Due to this change, the "Auto Detect" method may be removed in a future version (unless someone knows of a valid reason for keeping it).
> * MOD: Prevent Backgrounder preferences app from being backgrounded, otherwise settings might not be applied.

> # Version svn.r513
> - - -
> * NEW: Added background method "Auto Detect" (iOS 4.0+ only).
> * FIX: Status bar icons now work with iOS 4.0+.
>    - Requires phoenix3200's libstatusbar extension.
> * MOD: Removed use of preferences symbolic link, as it is not needed.
>    - The symlink ~/.backgrounderrc is no longer used, and can be manually deleted, if desired.
>    - Some apps still have issues due to Apple's sandbox; this will need to be fixed in a later release.
> * MOD: Changed maximum supported firmware version to 4.0.1.
>    - Note that Backgrounder purposely blocks untested firmware versions; this is to prevent the possibility of crashes with newer firmware.
>    - Jailbreak users should *never* upgrade to new iOS firmware versions until they are certain that the firmware is jailbreakable and that the extensions they wish to use have been properly updated.

> # Version svn.r504
> - - -
> * FIX: The settings file was not being loaded correctly.
>    - This is a long-standing bug that appears to affect all recent firmware (> 3.1.3?)
>    - This bug caused App Store apps to always use the Backgrounder method to background, even if set to use Native.
>    - Note that there may still be issues with some of Apple's default apps on 4.0.

> # Version svn.r502

> * MOD: The "Native" backgrounding method is now manually controllable.

> * MOD: Added a separate status bar icon image for the "Native" backgrounding method.

>    - "Backgrounding Persists" has been renamed to "Stay Enabled".
>    - The former blacklisting option is now acheived by creating an override and setting "Backgrounding method" to "Native".
>    - The former always-enabled option is now acheived by creating an override and enabling both "Enable at Launch" and "Stay Enabled".
> * MOD: Preferences app now supports iPad-mode (Portrait only).
> * NEW: Prevent apps such as Safari from backgrounding by setting "backgrounding method" to Off.
>    - Most people will want to do this via an override, as global settings would affect *all* apps.
> * NEW: Button to reset settings to default values.
> * NEW: Option to show a backgrounding status indicator in the status bar.
> * NEW: "Minimize on Toggle" option; disable to prevent current app from minimizing when enabling/disabling backgrounding.
> * NEW: "Fallback to Native" option; disable to force even apps such as Mail, Phone, Safari and iPod to quit on minimize when backgrounding state is disabled.
> * FIX: Fixed support for modifying badge via WinterBoard.
>    - File to theme is Backgrounder_Badge.png in the com.apple.springboard bundle.
> * FIX: Fixed iPad badge position.
