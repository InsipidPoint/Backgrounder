>    - All settings can now be set per-application (by creating an "override").
>    - "Backgrounding Persists" has been renamed to "Stay Enabled".
>    - The former blacklisting option is now acheived by creating an override and setting "Backgrounding method" to "Native".
>    - The former always-enabled option is now acheived by creating an override and enabling both "Enable at Launch" and "Stay Enabled".
> * MOD: Preferences app now supports iPad-mode (Portrait only).
> * NEW: Prevent apps such as Safari from backgrounding by setting "backgrounding method" to Off.
>    - Most people will want to do this via an override, as global settings would affect *all* apps.
> * NEW: Button to reset settings to default values.
> * NEW: Option to show a backgrounding status indicator in the status bar.
> * NEW: "Minimize on Toggle" option; disable to prevent current app from minimizing when enabling/disabling backgrounding.
> * NEW: "Fallback to Native" option; disable to force even apps such as Mail, Phone, Safari and iPod to quit on minimize when backgrounding state is disabled.
> * FIX: Fixed support for modifying badge via WinterBoard.
>    - File to theme is Backgrounder_Badge.png in the com.apple.springboard bundle.
> * FIX: Fixed iPad badge position.
>    - Badge origin is {-12, 39} for iPhone/iPod, {-12, 53} for iPad.
