To build this project:

1. Install an iOS toolchain for your system.
2. $ bash get_requirements.sh
3. $ export SYSROOT=<path to root of iOS SDK>
4. $ make

---

To create a .deb package that can be installed on your device:

1. $ make package

NOTE: While I would prefer that you do not distribute your own package, and that
      you would instead submit any patches to me instead, if you do decide to
      distribute, *please* be certain to:

1. Rename your package.
2. Change the author/maintainer information.
3. Make your package conflict with the original (my) package.

---

To install the package created in the previous step:

1. $ export FW_DEVICE_IP=<your device's IP address>
2. $ export FW_DEVICE_PORT=<your device's ssh port>
3. $ make install
