                    <li>There have been several reports of applications randomly quitting while backgrounded. In most cases, this is not due to a bug in Backgrounder, but to a lack of memory resources. The iPhone OS is designed so that when resources become low, a notification is sent to inactive applications asking them to either free-up memory, or to quit. The best practice is to not run too many (memory-intensive) applications at one time.</li>

                <li>Support for iPhone OS 3.0 is severely broken; currently
                only basic backgrounding is enabled. There is no time schedule
                for when the missing features will be restored (if
                restoration is even possible).
