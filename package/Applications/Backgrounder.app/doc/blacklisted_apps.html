                Certain applications (such as Apple's Phone and Mail, as
                well as mobileterminal and Categories folders) have built-in support
                for backgrounding; Backgrounder is not needed for nor should it be
                used with them.
                </p>

                <p>
                Marking an application as blacklisted prevents Backgrounder
                from attempting to background it. It also allows the
                application to be closed (force-quitted) via the Backgrounder
                task list.
