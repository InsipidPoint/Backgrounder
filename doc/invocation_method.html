                <p>Backgrounder provides two methods of invocation, both involving pressing of the Home button (the round hardware key with a white square, located at the bottom of the iPhone/iPod device).</p>

            <div>
                <p><strong>Hold Home Button</strong></p>
                <hr/>
                <p>Invoke Backgrounder by pressing down and holding the Home button until Backgrounder's pop-up appears (an alert in simple mode, a sliding-display in task list mode).</p>
                <p>Note that if you continue to hold the Home button after the pop-up appears, the current application will be forcibly terminated (the iPhone OS's default behavior).</p>

                <p><strong>Double-tap Home Button</strong></p>
                <hr/>
                <p>Invoke Backgrounder by quickly pressing and releasing the Home button twice; the Backgrounder pop-up will then appear.</p>
                <p> Note that normally double-tap is used to (optionally) invoke either the Phone or iPod application. When using Backgrounder's simple mode, the default behavior will no longer be accessible. With task list mode, double-tapping once will show the task list; double-tapping again (with the task list visible) will invoke the default behavior.</p>
