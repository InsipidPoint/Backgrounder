                <p>An alert pops-up stating that backgrounding has been activated, or deactivated if backgrounding had previously been enabled.</p>
                <p>After a brief pause, the alert will dismiss itself and the application will minimize. If backgrounding has just been activated, the application should now be running in the background. If deactivated, the application should no longer be running.</p>

                <hr/>
                <p>A list is presented showing the currently running (GUI-based) applications. The list allows for quickly switching to another running application, as well as to close those applications that are no longer needed (and thus free-up memory).</p>
                <p>For information on how to use the task list, please see the task list's built-in help screen.</p>
